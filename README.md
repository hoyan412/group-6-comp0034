Our web application is aimed towards the UK population with the goal of presenting clear visualisations of the UK nutrition data and 
providing a platform in which users can connect with one another on topics related to health.


This application uses flask, please run my_app.py to see the application running.

The app should allow you to create an account, which contains your personal information, and a profile which allows you to interact with the community. 
You should be able to edit all the information you enter and delete your profile or account.  

In the community you can create posts and comments, allowing discussions to take place between users. We have also added a like functionality, so that users can interact  without need to write a post or comment.
 
This flask app has also integrated the dash app from term 1, although the  dash app hasn't been significantly edited, most of our focus was on the flask app functions. 

Our testing uses pytest and selenium, all of these files are found in the tests folder.  

This GitHub repository contains all the files needed to run the app and tests. There are also some added files from Coursework 1, which do not need to be marked, these are: 'Fat', 'Nutrients', 'Protein' and 'Finaldatabase.sqlite'.
